# Game Summary
Steamheart is a local-multiplayer 4x style game for 2-6 players. This means that the goal is to Explore, Expand, Exploit, and Exterminate. To do this, each player starts with a capital city and should explore their surroundings by creating land tiles so that land units may traverse open spaces or by creating an airship which does not require land to traverse. Creating units requires resources, specifically, iron and wood. These are automatically gathered from mountain and forest tiles that are within a citiesâ€™ borders. A player can also create new cities by making the settler unit. To win, a player must take all of the capital cities of the other players. To lose, a player must have all of their cities taken by other players.

# Development Information
Steamheart was developed for the CSC631 Game Development class at San Francisco State University in the Spring 2023 semester. Steamheart was Team 2's game project and production ran from March to May. The GDD file represents the original vision for the game and not the delivered product.
